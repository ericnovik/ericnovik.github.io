This is the home for Math, Statistics and R Programming bootcamp offered by NYU PRIISM, the Center for Practice and Research at the Intersection of Information, Society, and Methodology. Registered students will be given access to [Brightspace](https://brightspace.nyu.edu/d2l/home/296393), where we will host an online forum.

The bootcamp aims to prepare students for the [Applied Statistics for Social Science Research](https://steinhardt.nyu.edu/degree/ms-applied-statistics-social-science-research) program at NYU. We will cover basic programming using the R language, including data manipulation and graphical displays; some key ideas from Calculus, including differentiation and integration; basic matrix algebra, including vector and matrix arithmetic; some core concepts in Probability, including random variables, discrete and continuous distributions, and expectations; and a few simple regression examples.
