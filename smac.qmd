This is the home for SMaC: Statistics, Math, and Computing Bootcamp offered by NYU PRIISM, the Center for Practice and Research at the Intersection of Information, Society, and Methodology. Registered students will be given access to [Brightspace](https://brightspace.nyu.edu/d2l/home/296393), where we will host an online forum.

SMaC aims to prepare students for the [Applied Statistics for Social Science Research](https://steinhardt.nyu.edu/degree/ms-applied-statistics-social-science-research) program at NYU. We will cover basic programming using the R language, including data manipulation and graphical displays; some key ideas from Calculus, including differentiation and integration, basic matrix algebra, including vector and matrix arithmetic; some core concepts in Probability, including random variables, discrete and continuous distributions, and expectations; and a few simple regression examples.

This is the current version of the syllabus: [syllabus.pdf](stats-math/syllabus.pdf), which is subject to change, so please check the date to make sure you have the most recent version.
