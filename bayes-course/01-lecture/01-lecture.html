<p>What do you think the range of certainty scores will look like: will there be any 0’s or 10’s? Will there be a positive relation between x and y: are guesses with higher certainty be more accurate, on average? How strong will the relation be between x and y: what will the curve look like?

<h2>Overall Expected Prize With the Extra Ball</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Combine the two cases:</strong></p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
EV_{\text{extra}} = P(\text{red})\times7.593 + P(\text{green})\times3.600.
\]</span></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Calculation:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><span class="math display">\[0.589 \times 7.593 \approx 4.465,\]</span></li>
<li><span class="math display">\[0.411 \times 3.600 \approx 1.480.\]</span></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Thus:</strong></p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
EV_{\text{extra}} \approx 4.465 + 1.480 = 5.945.
\]</span></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Net Expected Payoff (including costs):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Extra ball cost: $1</li>
<li>Play cost: $2</li>
<li>Total cost: $3</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="math display">\[

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Without the extra ball:</strong> Net EV <span class="math inline">\(\approx \$3.96\)</span>.</li>
<li><strong>With the extra ball:</strong> Net EV <span class="math inline">\(\approx \$2.95\)</span>.</li>

<p><strong>Decision:</strong> It is better to pay $2 and play immediately rather than buying an extra ball.</p>
