## Course description

This course will introduce students to Bayesian data analysis and Bayesian workflow, which is a process that we follow to develop statistical models, test their efficacy, and make model improvements. This is a deep subject with a rich history and we can only offer an introductory treatment during a seven-week course. Nonetheless, motiviated students should get enough experience from this course to learn how to think like a Baysian, be able to fit standard models usint Bayesian inference, evalute the quality of the model, and make predictions.

During the course we will make extensive use of simulations, the R language, Stan, and the `rstanarm` package.

## Times, Location, and Office Hours

In-person weekly lectures will be held every Monday from 5 -- 8 PM in Room XYZ beginning on March 21 and ending on May 15. Office hours will be held over Zoom on Tuesdays from 5 -- 6 PM.

## Course prerequisites

Students should be familiar with the R language, as we will not have time to provide the introduction to R. Ideally, students will be comfortable with probability and basic differential and integral calculus and have taken a basic regression course. Students don't have to be familiar with Stan, or `rstanarm`, and no prior knowledge of Bayes is expected.

## Course materials

The core text for the course will be "Bayed Rules!" @johnson2022 which is available for free [online](https://www.bayesrulesbook.com/) and as a paper copy from [CRC Press](https://www.routledge.com/Bayes-Rules-An-Introduction-to-Applied-Bayesian-Modeling/Johnson-Ott-Dogucu/p/book/9780367255398).

Students are expected to have access to R and RStudio or another R programming environment of their choice. Students should follow the setup instructions from the [Getting set up](https://www.bayesrulesbook.com/preface.html#setup) chapter.

## Course Outline

The following tentative schedule assumes seven 3-hour sessions during which we plan to cover the following material.

-   **(1) Bayesian Workflow**

    We will briefly discuss the history of Bayesian inference and introduce the key components of the Bayesian workflow --- from model development, to model testing and decision-making. We will dig into the key components of the so called Bayes' rule.

    -   Bayes Rules!, Chapters [1](https://www.bayesrulesbook.com/chapter-1.html) and [2](https://www.bayesrulesbook.com/chapter-2.html)

-   **(2) Conjugate models: Beta-Binomial**

    In otder to demonstrate the Bayesian machinery, we will go over a few simple models for which analytical solutions are available. In practice, we seldom use conjugate models, but they have pedagogical value, are very fast, and allow us to validate numerical methods.

## Grading

There will be six homework assignments, each worth 10% and an analysis project which can be completed in groups of up to three people. All assignments must be completed in [R Markdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/lesson-1.html), [Quarto](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/hello/rstudio.html), or similar systems suitable for scientific publication.

-   Homework: 60%
-   Analysis project: 30%
-   Class participation: 10%
