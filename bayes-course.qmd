This is the home of the Spring 2024 Bayesian Inference class at NYU Steinhardt. If you are enrolled in the course, the assignment will be posted on [Brightspace](https://brightspace.nyu.edu/). 

[This](bayes-course/syllabus.pdf) is the current version of the syllabus. Please check the date, as it is subject to change.

### Lectures
The following is a preliminary lecture plan. We will add the links after each lecture.

-   Lecture 01: Introduction and Bayesian Workflow
-   Lecture 02: Conjugate Models and Beta-Binomial
-   Lecture 03: More Conjugate Models and Introduction to Posterior Sampling
-   Lecture 04: MCMC, Posterior Inference, and Prediction
-   Lecture 05: Linear Regression and Model Evaluation
-   Lecture 06: Expanding the linear model and modeling counts
-   Lecture 07: Introduction to hierarchical models


The final project is due at the end of the semester, and the presentations will take place during finals week. Use [these](bayes-course/project-template.pdf) guidelines when working on your proposal and the final report.
